EX1

Just a simple "Hello world" program.

EX2

A simple fortran program to inquire about the intricacies of single and double precision floating point numbers in Fortran. 

EX3

A comparison of some algorithms for calculating a matrix-matrix product. 
The source file, ex3.f, should be compiled 4 times with different optimization flags, and names "ex3_opt<n>.x", 
where the n stands for the number of the optimization flag (if no optimization is chosen, simply "ex3.x").
Then, simply running the python script "autocontrol.py" will run the executables and produce the results and plots.
IMPORTANT: the python script requires Pyhton3 to be installed, otherwise it will not work!
IMPORTANT: the .txt files with the numeric results of the timings are not in the set of files because the system did not allow
 more than 20 files,so I chose to exclude these. They can however be produced by running "autocontrol.py"
